Udemy - Mastery of Docker

While I did not take notes over the entire course (many of the beginning lectures I already had experience with) 
there are notes on the more intermediate to advanced features of docker.

I would highly recommend the course; Bret Fisher was a fantastic online tutor and the community in slack was a nice touch.
