Data Volumes

The first place to tell a container that it needs to add a VOLUME is in the DockerFile (See MySQL Database example)


VOLUME /var/lib/mysql 

This line tells docker the default location of the MySQL databases. 
The image will tell docker when a new container is created a new volume location is to be created and assigned to it.

Volumes require manual deletion, removing a container does not remove the volume.

On MacOS and Windows the location will not be visible on the host machine via the $PATH as it is on linux machines.
This is due to the fact that to run on Windows and MAC there is more going on in the background; docker is creating a Linux VM 
this is where the data is being stored.
